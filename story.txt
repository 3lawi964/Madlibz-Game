One dark[a] spooky[a] night , no stars in sight . Thunder roaded a scary[a] , lightning flashed the trees below . The sound of a Wolf[an] could be heard in th distance . 
It was Halloween night . I was dresses as a Dracula[a] . My bag was beside me filled with delicious[a] candies[f] that I couldn't wait to eat .
As I went[v] up the driveway of a house to trivk or treat , I wonder what type of sweets[n] I will get . 
I ring the doorbell then it opens and a tall[a] man wearing a Frankenstein[n] looks at me .
I scream , " Trick or treat , smell my feet![n] "
